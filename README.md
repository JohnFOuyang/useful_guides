# Finding Differentially Expressed Genes: A Novice's Experience with DESeq2
This guide documents the use of DESeq2 to perform differential gene expression analysis from a novice perspective. This entire procedure can be broken down into several steps, namely (i) preparation of input data, (ii) quality control, (iii) running DESeq2.

Throughout this guide, paragraphs beginning with "**Extra Thoughts**" highlights deeper questions that can arise from some of the data treatment. Furthermore, paragraphs beginning with "**Coding**" highlight things to look out for when coding DESeq2.
